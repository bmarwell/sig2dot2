We use some testing keyrings to simulate correct behaviour.

(1)
    A keyring with just one key should create a dot file with just one object.
    0 given (no others)
    0 gotten (no others)
    * no ratio (set to 1)
    * red = 0 / 1 = 0
    * green = 0 / 0 / 1 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/3 (assuming ratio will be 1 [default] and then be devided by 1)
    * blue = 0 / 1 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/3

(2)
    A keyring with two keys, signed each other, should create a dot file
    with to objects and one line with two arrows.
    Both objects should have the same colours:
    * red = 1 / 1 = 1
    * green = 1 / 1 / 1 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 5/6
    * blue = 1 / 1 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1

(3)
    A keyring with two keys, A signed B, but B did not sign A.
    A:
    * red = 0 / 1 = 0
    * green = 1 / 0 / 1 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/3
    * blue = 1 / 1 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1
    B:
    * red = 1 / 1 = 1
    * green = 0 / 1 / 1 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/3
    * blue = 0 / 1 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/3

(4) A, B, C.
    A signed B and C
    B signed A and C
    C signed A and not B.
    A got two, gave two.
    B got one, gave two.
    C got two, gave one.
    max_ratio = 2 (by C)
    A:
    * red = 2 / 2 = 1
    * green = 2 / 2 / 2 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/4 + 1/3 = 7/12 = 0.58333.
    * blue = 2 / 2 = 1
    B:
    * red = 1 / 2 = 0.5
    * green = 2 / 1 / 2 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 = 0.83333.
    * blue = 2 / 2 = 1
    C: 
    * red = 2 / 2 = 1
    * green = 1 / 2 / 2 * 0.75 * 2/3 + 1/3 = 1/8 + 1/3 = 11/24 = 0.458333.
    * blue = 1 / 2 = 0.5


Calculation:
ratio =  given / gotten
for key in keylist.values():                                             
    red = len(key.sigsGotten) / max_signed                                                                                                                                                          
    green = (len(key.signedOthers) / len(key.sigsGotten) / max_ratio * 0.75) * 2/3 + 1/3
    blue = (len(key.signedOthers) / max_sigs) * 2/3 + 1/3       

the red-value says, how close an individual is to the maximum numbers of signatures an indivudial has gotten. One has to be full red, therefore.
the green-value says... well... how close you are to the maximum ratio of given/gotten signatures. Cannot exeed 5/6 because of .75 factor.
the blue-value says, how close an individual is to the maxmimum number of signatures given by a single individual. One has to be full blue, therefore.

About the colour coding: Ask Darxus@ChaosReigns.com or Christopher Berg why the chose to do so (especially why to limit green to 5/6.
